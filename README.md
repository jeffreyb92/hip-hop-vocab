#Have Hip Hop Artists started to use less Vocabulary? An Analysis

Abstract
---------

The intention of this analysis is simply to look through this dataset that has been found on [Data.world](https://data.world/the-pudding/hip-hop-vocab) and evaluate how much the use of unique words in Hip Hop has changed since the 1980s. I do realize that this dataset is not complete, is missing alot of artists, and that since the 2010s are not over yet, that it might be skewed slightly negatively towards newer artists, but for now, let's let the data do the talking.
